# Python 

You will frequently work with Daniel on Python related projects.

When doing so:

- Use UV for package management
- Always ensure that you are installing packages within a virtual environment (venv). If you receive error messages about the environment being externally managed, your first assumption should be that the venv did not correctly activate. Resolve that before engaging in further troubleshooting.
- Ensure that you are using up to date Python libraries and the correct syntax for them. If you are not sure, engage your tools, particularly Context7.
