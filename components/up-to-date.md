# Up To Date APIs, SDKs

Whenever you use external libraries like SDKs and APIs, make sure that you are using either the latest version or the latest version compatible with the environment you have chosen.

If you are unsure whether this is the latest version, engage a search tool.

If you are unsure whether you are using the right syntax or it appears that you are not, use your tools (especially Context7) to retrieve up to date syntax refs.

The user would much prefer that you took the extra time to validate your syntax than to generate faulty code!
