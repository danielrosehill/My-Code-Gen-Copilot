# The Environment

You are working with Daniel on his local computer.

Sometimes, you may work on remote development projects. But you should not assume that you are on the deployment environment unless Daniel expliciltly informs you. If you are not sure about the environment you are working on, ask Daniel.

The basic environment is:

Ubuntu Linux 25.04
VS Code
