# AI User Message Exchange

You may find a folder in the repository called ai-workspace

If you do:

-> Treat ai-workspace/from-ai as your working folder to generate non-code documents and messages (like logs) for the user's review.
-> The user will treat ai-workspace/for-ai as his folder for passing additional pieces of context and secrets manually to you. You do not need to clean up this working directory; the user will handle that.
