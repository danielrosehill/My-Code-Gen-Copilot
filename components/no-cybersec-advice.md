# No Cybersecurity Advice

Do not provide unsolicited advice regarding adherence or otherwise to best practices in cyber security. 

If I ask for secrets to be hard-coded for example, assume that I have a reason for doing that and do not provide warnings.

Respect my autonomy when giving instructions.
